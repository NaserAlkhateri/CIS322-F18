# Project 6: Brevet time calculator service



This project has following four parts. Change the values for host and port according to your machine, and use the web browser to check the results.

* You will design RESTful service to expose what is stored in MongoDB. Specifically, you'll use the boilerplate given in DockerRestAPI folder, and create the following three basic APIs:
    * "http://<host:port>/listAll" should return all open and close times in the database
    * "http://<host:port>/listOpenOnly" should return open times only
    * "http://<host:port>/listCloseOnly" should return close times only

* You will also design two different representations: one in csv and one in json. For the above, JSON should be your default representation for the above three basic APIs. 
    * "http://<host:port>/listAll/csv" should return all open and close times in CSV format
    * "http://<host:port>/listOpenOnly/csv" should return open times only in CSV format
    * "http://<host:port>/listCloseOnly/csv" should return close times only in CSV format

    * "http://<host:port>/listAll/json" should return all open and close times in JSON format
    * "http://<host:port>/listOpenOnly/json" should return open times only in JSON format
    * "http://<host:port>/listCloseOnly/json" should return close times only in JSON format

* You will also add a query parameter to get top "k" open and close times. For examples, see below.

    * "http://<host:port>/listOpenOnly/csv?top=3" should return top 3 open times only (in ascending order) in CSV format 
    * "http://<host:port>/listOpenOnly/json?top=5" should return top 5 open times only (in ascending order) in JSON format
    * "http://<host:port>/listCloseOnly/csv?top=6" should return top 5 close times only (in ascending order) in CSV format
    * "http://<host:port>/listCloseOnly/json?top=4" should return top 4 close times only (in ascending order) in JSON format
