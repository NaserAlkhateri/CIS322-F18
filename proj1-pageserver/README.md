Description: This is proj1-pageserver, in this assignment we are asked to 
edit pageserver.py to handle certain rules, taking a page input checks if it has
any forbidden charecters and check if the file is actuall available.
All errors are handled with the help of making two functions and if statements.
One function is in-charge of validating the ending of the input, the other
checks if the file is available and reads it. Some conditioned applied so 
the code works like it has been asked to.
